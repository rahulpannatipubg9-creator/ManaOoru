# Multiplayer: lessons

Code: `scripts/network/` (squad, sync), `scripts/tactical/` (Team Deathmatch). Design: `docs/TDM_DESIGN.md`.

## Entries

### Changing rules or messages without a version bump (2026-10-29)
- **Rule:** any change to hit claims, damage, fire rate or RPC arguments bumps `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in
  `tdm_session.gd` (now 2). A joiner on another version is refused with "Different game version", so the tablet
  and the phone always need the same build.

### Squeezing new state into the sync (2026-10-29)
- **Rule:** extend the stance code bits rather than the RPC signature when the value is small (bit 4 aim,
  bits 8+ rifle id), and make "no bits" mean the old behaviour so an older build still reads it.

### Never trust a client's numbers
- The host decides damage from the rifle id, limits the fire rate per rifle, and checks positions, range and
  walls (`_claim_problem()`). New claims must go through the same checks.
